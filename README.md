# Graduation Project: Augmented Reality Integrated Online Store

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for my graduation project, an online store integrated into augmented reality. This project leverages cutting-edge augmented reality (AR) technology and various filters to provide an immersive and interactive shopping experience.

## Project Overview
### Augmented Reality Technology
Augmented reality is a technology that overlays digital content, such as 3D models, animations, and information, onto the real world through the use of devices like smartphones and AR glasses. In this project, we explore the potential of AR to enhance the online shopping experience.

### Features
- **AR Product Visualization**: Users can view products in a real-world context by superimposing 3D models of the products into their physical environment.
- **Try Before You Buy**: Customers can "try on" products virtually, such as clothing and accessories, using AR filters that map to their body or face.
- A CRUD application exposed using a RESTful API made with Node.js
- Optimized app for speed and user experience
- **Interactive Shopping**: Enhanced interactivity through gestures, touch, or voice commands, allowing users to browse and interact with products in novel ways.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-driven recommendations based on user preferences and browsing history, providing a tailored shopping experience.
